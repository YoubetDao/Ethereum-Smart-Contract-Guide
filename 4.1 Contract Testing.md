## About This Section

Writing **unit tests** is an essential part of ensuring the reliability of code in Solidity smart contract development. Since contracts cannot be modified once deployed, any issues discovered post-deployment could be catastrophic (assuming proxy contracts are not used).

In this section, we will cover how to write test code for Solidity contracts, including **the structure of test code**, how to **run tests**, and step-by-step **test case writing**.

## Writing Unit Tests

### Test Code Structure & Elements

Understanding the basic structure of test code is crucial when writing Solidity contract tests. Hardhat uses the **Mocha testing framework** along with the **Chai assertion library** to help write and organize test cases.

**Test File Location**:
Hardhat stores test code uniformly in the `test/` directory. For example, `test/todo.ts`.

**The structure of the test code** typically looks like this:

```typescript
import ...

describe("Todo Contract", function () {

  this.beforeEach(() => {
    // Initialization code executed before each test
    ...
  });

  // Reuse initialization code to avoid redeploying contracts in each test
  async function deployTodo() {
    ...
    return { todo, owner };
  }

  describe("Create Task", function () {
    it("Should create task successfully", async function () {
      const { todo } = await loadFixture(deployTodo);
      // Execute code and verify the result meets expectations
      ...
    });
  });
});
```

In this example, `describe` and `it` are used to organize the test structure, while `loadFixture` helps reuse the contract deployment logic, ensuring each test is run under the same conditions. Next, we'll explain the key concepts found in this code.

**Test Code Elements**:

- `describe`: Defines a test module or group. It is typically used for logical grouping to organize related tests, such as all test cases for a specific smart contract. `describe` can be nested, so when testing a specific feature or scenario of a contract with multiple test cases, you can use `describe` to group them.
- `it`: Defines individual test cases, specifying the expected behavior and validation logic. For example, inside `it`, you write test logic to ensure a specific feature (like a function call) works as intended.
- `beforeEach`: Setup tasks performed before each test case, commonly used to initialize contracts or set up the environment.
- `loadFixture`: A handy technique to improve test efficiency. Deploying a contract in every test can be time-consuming, but `loadFixture` caches the deployment process, speeding up testing. It takes a function as an argument, such as `deployTodo`, where you define the initialization steps like contract deployment and data setup.

### Running Unit Tests

Once test code is written, we need to run it to verify the contract's behavior.

Hardhat provides convenient tools to run tests, and you can even **run specific test cases** selectively. (The following commands can be executed in the `example/solidity_todo_example` directory.)

- Run all tests: Use `yarn hardhat test` to run all test files in the project.
- Run a single test file: Specify the file path to run a specific test file, such as `yarn hardhat test test/Todo.ts`.
- **Run specific test cases**: Use the `--grep` keyword to filter and run only the test cases you want. Example command: `yarn hardhat test --grep "Should create task successfully"`. This command will only run the test case with “Create Task” in its name. **This method is highly efficient during debugging, especially when you are only focused on specific contract features**.

### Writing Test Code

Next, we will introduce how to write test cases step by step.

#### 1. Deploy the Contract

First, we need to deploy the contract to be tested. By using Hardhat’s `ethers.getContractFactory`, we can retrieve the contract factory and then deploy the contract with the `.deploy()` method.

```typescript
async function deployTodo() {
	const [owner] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();
	const ToDo = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("Todo");
	const todo = await ToDo.deploy();
	return { todo, owner };
}
```

After deployment, we will use `loadFixture` to reuse this code in the tests, ensuring that each test starts from a clean state.

#### 2. Create Task Test

Next, we’ll write the first test case to verify that tasks can be created successfully. We use `todo.createTask` to create a task and Chai’s `expect` assertion to confirm that the operation was not rejected and that the new task can be retrieved by its ID.

```typescript
it("Should create task successfully", async function () {
	const { todo } = await loadFixture(deployTodo);

	const nextTaskId = await todo.nextTaskId();
	const taskContent = "Write a contract for the todo list";

	await expect(todo.createTask(taskContent)).to.not.be.rejected;

	const result = await todo.tasks(nextTaskId);
	expect(result.id).to.eq(nextTaskId);
	expect(result.content).to.eq(taskContent);
});
```

#### 3. Event Test

In `src/Todo.sol`, the `TaskCreated` event should be emitted after a task is successfully created. We will write a test to ensure that the event is triggered correctly and that the event’s parameters match expectations.

```typescript
it("Should emit a TaskCreated event", async function () {
	const { todo } = await loadFixture(deployTodo);
	const taskContent = "Write a contract for the todo list";
	const nextTaskId = await todo.nextTaskId();

	await expect(todo.createTask(taskContent))
		.to.emit(todo, "TaskCreated")
		.withArgs(nextTaskId, anyValue, taskContent, false);
});
```

Here, `anyValue` is used to ignore unimportant parameters (such as timestamps), focusing on verifying the event’s key parameters: task ID and content.

The above examples demonstrate how to test the **task creation feature**. Similarly, you can try writing test cases to verify features like **toggleDone** and **deleteTask**, further solidifying your understanding. By completing these exercises, you'll become more familiar with the entire contract testing process.

## Summary
